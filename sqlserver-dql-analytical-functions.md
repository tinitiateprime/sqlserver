# DQL - Analytical Functions
* Analytical functions in SQL Server are used to perform calculations on a group of rows and return a single result set for each group, based on the values in one or more columns, often within a specified window or partition.
* They enable performing advanced calculations and aggregations on your data for advanced data analysis and reports.
* These functions are typically used in conjunction with the 'OVER' clause to define the window or subset of rows over which the function should operate.
* The OVER clause can include 'PARTITION BY' or 'ORDER BY' specifications to control the behavior of the window function.
* The 'PARTITION BY' clause is used to divide the result set of a query into partitions to which the function is applied independently.
* The 'ORDER BY' clause is used to sort the result set of a query into the orders specified to which the function is applied independently.
* For some analytical functions 'PARTITION BY' clause must be used including 'ORDER BY' clause.

## Analytical functions in SQL Server:
### Aggregate Functions:
* Aggregate functions with Analytical functions, extends the analytical capability of SQL queries by allowing aggregations to be computed over specific partitions or ordered subsets of data, providing deeper insights and flexibility in analyzing relational datasets.
```sql
-- All aggregation functions for each department
SELECT  deptno
        ,count(sal) AS count_dept_sal
       ,max(sal) AS max_dept_sal
       ,min(sal) AS min_dept_sal
       ,sum(sal) AS tot_dept_sal
       ,avg(sal) AS avg_dept_sal
FROM  employees.emp e
GROUP BY deptno;

-- All aggregation functions on emp table with respect to every dept 
SELECT  e.*
       ,max(sal) OVER () AS max_sal
       ,max(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno) AS max_dept_sal
       ,min(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno) AS min_dept_sal
       ,sum(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno) AS tot_dept_sal
       ,avg(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno) AS avg_dept_sal
       ,count(1) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno) AS emp_count_by_dept
FROM   employees.emp e;
```
### ROW_NUMBER():
* Assigns a unique sequential number to each row, starting with 1.
```sql
-- Assigns a unique integer to each row to establish the row's position within
-- the partition of a result set.
SELECT empno, ename, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY empno) AS row_num
FROM employees.emp;

-- Assigns a unique integer to each row within the partition.
SELECT empno, ename, deptno, ROW_NUMBER() OVER
 (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY empno) AS row_num FROM employees.emp;

-- Assigns a unique integer to each row within a partition, based on salary,
-- for each department.
SELECT deptno, ename, sal,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees.emp;

-- Find the employee with the highest salary in each department
SELECT deptno, ename, sal
FROM (
    SELECT deptno, ename, sal,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC) AS row_num
    FROM employees.emp
) AS ranked
WHERE row_num = 1;

-- Multi-Ordered Row Numbering
SELECT  row_number() OVER (ORDER BY sal)      AS sal_rn_asc,
        row_number() OVER (ORDER BY sal DESC) AS sal_rn_desc,
        row_number() OVER (ORDER BY empno)    AS empno_rn,
        e.*
FROM    employees.emp e
ORDER BY deptno;

-- Multi-Partitioned Row Numbering
SELECT  row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal)
         AS sal_rn_asc,
        row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC)
         AS sal_rn_desc,
        row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY empno)
         AS empno_rn,
        e.*
FROM    employees.emp e
ORDER BY deptno;
```
### RANK():
* Assigns a unique rank to each row, with the same rank for rows with equal values.
```sql
-- Assigns a unique integer to each distinct row within the partition of a
-- result set, leaving gaps between the ranks if there are ties.
SELECT ename, sal, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sal DESC) AS rank
FROM employees.emp;

-- Assigns a rank to each employee within their department based on their salary
SELECT deptno, ename, sal,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC) AS rank
FROM employees.emp;
```
### DENSE_RANK():
* Assigns a unique rank to each row, without gaps, with the same rank for rows with equal values.
```sql
-- Assigns a unique integer to each distinct row within the partition of a
-- result set, without gaps in the ranking sequence.
SELECT ename, sal, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sal DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees.emp;

-- Assigns a dense rank to each employee within their department based
-- on their salary.
SELECT deptno, ename, sal,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees.emp;

-- Multi-functions with Multi-orders example
SELECT  e.*,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sal DESC)       AS rank,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sal DESC) AS dense_rank,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sal DESC) AS rn
FROM    employees.emp e;

-- Multi-functions with Multi-Partitions example
SELECT  e.*,
        RANK()       OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC)       AS rank,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC) AS dense_rank,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC) AS rn
FROM    employees.emp e;
```
### NTILE(n):
* Divides the result set into 'n' groups, assigning a group number to each row.
```sql
-- Divides the result set into a specified number of roughly equal
-- groups or "tiles".
SELECT ename, sal, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY sal DESC) AS quartile
FROM employees.emp;

-- Divides employees into quartiles based on their salary within each department
SELECT deptno, ename, sal,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal DESC) AS quartile
FROM employees.emp;
```
### LAG():
* Accesses data from a previous row in the result set.
```sql
-- Retrieves employee names and salaries, along with the
-- previous salary for each employee.
SELECT ename, sal,
       LAG(sal) OVER (ORDER BY sal) AS prev_sal
FROM employees.emp;

-- Retrieves the previous salary for each employee, ordered by their hire date.
SELECT empno, ename, hiredate, sal,
       LAG(sal) OVER (ORDER BY hiredate) AS prev_sal
FROM employees.emp;
```
### LEAD():
* Accesses data from a following row in the result set.
```sql
-- Retrieves employee names and salaries, along with
-- the next salary for each employee.
SELECT ename, sal,
       LEAD(sal) OVER (ORDER BY sal) AS next_sal
FROM employees.emp;

-- Retrieves the next salary for each employee, ordered by their hire date.
SELECT empno, ename, hiredate, sal,
       LEAD(sal) OVER (ORDER BY hiredate) AS next_sal
FROM employees.emp;

-- Lag and Lead example
SELECT empno, sal,
       LEAD(sal) OVER (ORDER BY sal) AS next_salary,
       LAG(sal) OVER (ORDER BY sal) AS previous_salary
FROM employees.emp;

-- Calculates the difference in salary between an employee and
-- the next and previous employee within each department.
SELECT deptno, ename, sal,
       sal - LAG(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal)
        AS sal_diff_with_prev,
       LEAD(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal) - sal
        AS sal_diff_with_next
FROM employees.emp;
```
### FIRST_VALUE():
* Returns the first value in an ordered set of values.
```sql
-- Retrieves employee names and salaries, along with
-- the first salary in the sorted order.
SELECT ename, sal,
       FIRST_VALUE(sal) OVER (ORDER BY sal) AS first_sal
FROM employees.emp;

-- Finds the first salary for each department and
-- compares it with each employee's salary.
SELECT empno, ename, deptno, sal,
       sal - FIRST_VALUE(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY hiredate)
        AS sal_diff_with_first
FROM employees.emp;
```
### LAST_VALUE():
* Returns the last value in an ordered set of values.
```sql
-- Retrieves employee names and salaries,
-- along with the last salary in the sorted order.
SELECT ename, sal,
       LAST_VALUE(sal) OVER (ORDER BY sal) AS last_sal
FROM employees.emp;

-- Finds the last salary for each department and
-- compares it with each employee's salary.
SELECT empno, ename, deptno, sal,
       sal - LAST_VALUE(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY
        hiredate ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
         AS sal_diff_with_last
FROM employees.emp;

-- Finds the difference between each employee's salary and
-- the first and last salary within their department.
SELECT deptno, ename, sal,
       sal - FIRST_VALUE(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal)
        AS sal_diff_with_first,
       LAST_VALUE(sal) OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY
        sal ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) - sal
         AS sal_diff_with_last
FROM employees.emp;
```

# Loops
* Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. 

## WHILE Loop
* The `WHILE` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

While your example is a good introduction, the primary lesson for advanced T-SQL training is that you should almost always avoid WHILE loops for data manipulation. T-SQL is a set-based language, meaning it's optimized to process entire sets of data at once. Row-by-row processing (often called RBAR, or "Row-By-Agonizing-Row") is incredibly inefficient and can lead to major performance issues on large tables.

The following examples illustrate the correct, set-based approach and provide a better use case for loops in T-SQL.

###  Set-Based Alternative (The Correct Way) 🏆
Your original example uses a WHILE loop to update salaries one employee at a time. The correct, set-based way to do this is with a single UPDATE statement. This one command performs the same operation on all rows simultaneously, which is exponentially faster and less resource-intensive.

#### Inefficient RBAR Method (Your original example):

```sql

DECLARE @EmpID INT;

SELECT @EmpID = MIN(empno) FROM employees.emp;

WHILE @EmpID IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees.emp SET sal = sal * 1.10 WHERE empno = @EmpID;
    SELECT @EmpID = MIN(empno) FROM employees.emp WHERE empno > @EmpID;
END

```
#### Efficient Set-Based Method:

```sql

UPDATE employees.emp
SET sal = sal * 1.10;

```
This single statement is the preferred method for updating all employee salaries.

### Appropriate Use of WHILE Loops 💡
A WHILE loop is best suited for tasks that are inherently iterative and cannot be easily performed with a single set-based statement. This includes administrative tasks, dynamic SQL generation, and handling certain types of hierarchical data.

* Example: Finding an Employee's Managerial Hierarchy

This example uses a WHILE loop to find an employee's manager, then that manager's manager, and so on, all the way up the chain to the president. This task is difficult to do in a single, simple set-based query without using more advanced features like Recursive CTEs (Common Table Expressions), making a loop a viable solution.

```sql
DECLARE @CurrentEmpID INT = 7566; -- Start with employee JONES
DECLARE @CurrentEmpName VARCHAR(10);
DECLARE @MgrID INT;
DECLARE @Level INT = 1;

PRINT 'Hierarchy for Employee: JONES';
PRINT '----------------------------';

WHILE @CurrentEmpID IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    -- Get the current employee's name and their manager's ID
    SELECT @CurrentEmpName = ename, @MgrID = mgr
    FROM employees.emp
    WHERE empno = @CurrentEmpID;
    
    -- Print the current level and employee name
    PRINT 'Level ' + CAST(@Level AS VARCHAR) + ': ' + @CurrentEmpName;

    -- Move up the hierarchy
    SET @CurrentEmpID = @MgrID;
    SET @Level = @Level + 1;
END

```
* In this example, we use a `WHILE` loop to increase the salaries of all employees in the emp table by 10%. The loop continues until there are no more employees to update.

## FOR Loop
* T-SQL doesn't have a native FOR loop construct, but you can effectively replicate its behavior using a WHILE loop combined with a counter variable. This is a common pattern in T-SQL programming.

* Simulating a FOR Loop
    The FOR loop in other languages typically has three parts:

* Initialization: Setting a counter variable to a starting value.

* Condition: The expression that is checked before each iteration to determine if the loop should continue.

* Iteration: The action that modifies the counter variable (e.g., incrementing or decrementing it) after each iteration.

You can combine these three elements within a T-SQL WHILE loop to create the same functionality. The initialization happens before the loop, the condition is part of the WHILE statement, and the iteration happens inside the loop's BEGIN...END block.

``` sql
-- Print Names of First 3 Projects
DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;

WHILE @Counter <= 3
BEGIN
    SELECT project_name FROM employees.projects WHERE projectno = @Counter;
    SET @Counter = @Counter + 1;
END
```
DECLARE @EmpID INT = 7521; -- Start with WARD
DECLARE @MgrID INT;
DECLARE @MgrName VARCHAR(10);

-- Find the initial manager for the given employee
SELECT @MgrID = mgr
FROM employees.emp
WHERE empno = @EmpID;

-- Loop until the manager ID is NULL (the top of the hierarchy)
WHILE @MgrID IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    -- Get the name and next manager in the chain
    SELECT @MgrName = ename, @MgrID = mgr
    FROM employees.emp
    WHERE empno = @MgrID;

    PRINT 'Manager Name: ' + @MgrName;
END;
GO

```sql



```
* In this example, we use a `WHILE` loop to print the names of the first 3 projects from the projects table. The loop runs as long as the @Counter variable is less than or equal to 3.

## DO WHILE Loop
* T-SQL does not have a native DO WHILE loop. It can be simulated by using a standard WHILE loop and carefully placing the loop condition check at the end of the code block, ensuring the code inside the loop executes at
  least once.
* Simulating DO WHILE with WHILE
    The core difference between a WHILE and a DO WHILE loop is the order of operations.
    A standard WHILE loop first checks the condition and then executes the code block. If the condition is false from the start, the code block never runs.
  
* A DO WHILE loop, by contrast, first executes the code block, and then checks the condition. This guarantees that the code block will execute at least one time, regardless of the starting condition.

To replicate this behavior in T-SQL, you simply structure your WHILE loop so that the action you want to perform is executed before the condition is evaluated.
```sql
-- Add New Projects Until 10 Projects Exist
DECLARE @Count INT;

SELECT @Count = COUNT(*) FROM employees.projects;

WHILE @Count < 10
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employees.projects (projectno, project_name, budget) VALUES (@Count+1, 'New Project', 50000.00);
    SELECT @Count = COUNT(*) FROM employees.projects;
END
```


```sql

-- Step 1: Set up initial variables
DECLARE @DeptNo INT = 10; -- 'ACCOUNTING' department
DECLARE @EmployeeCount INT;
DECLARE @NewEmpID INT;

-- Step 2: Get the initial employee count for the department
SELECT @EmployeeCount = COUNT(*) FROM employees.emp WHERE deptno = @DeptNo;

-- Step 3: Simulate the DO WHILE loop
PRINT 'Starting employees in Accounting: ' + CAST(@EmployeeCount AS VARCHAR);

WHILE @EmployeeCount < 5
BEGIN
    -- This block will execute at least once
    
    -- Find the next available employee ID
    SELECT @NewEmpID = ISNULL(MAX(empno), 7000) + 1 FROM employees.emp;

    -- Insert a new employee into the 'ACCOUNTING' department
    INSERT INTO employees.emp (empno, ename, job, hiredate, sal, deptno)
    VALUES (@NewEmpID, 'NEW HIRE', 'CLERK', GETDATE(), 1000.00, @DeptNo);

    -- Update the employee count for the next loop check
    SELECT @EmployeeCount = COUNT(*) FROM employees.emp WHERE deptno = @DeptNo;
    
    PRINT 'Added new employee. Current count: ' + CAST(@EmployeeCount AS VARCHAR);

    -- The condition (@EmployeeCount < 5) is checked here at the END of the loop
END;

PRINT 'Final employee count in Accounting: ' + CAST(@EmployeeCount AS VARCHAR);

-- You can also view the new employees
SELECT ename, job, deptno
FROM employees.emp
WHERE deptno = @DeptNo;

```
* In this example, we use a `WHILE` loop to simulate a `DO WHILE` loop by continuously adding new projects to the projects table until there are 10 projects. The loop checks the condition at the end of each iteration, ensuring that the code inside the loop is executed at least once.

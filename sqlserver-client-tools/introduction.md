* SQL Server provides multiple command-line tools that are essential for automation, ETL, and DevOps:

  * BCP (Bulk Copy Program) → Fast data import/export between SQL Server and files (CSV, TXT).
  
  * SQLCMD → Run T-SQL queries, scripts, and stored procedures from the command line.

These are critical for **performance testing**, **data migration**, and **automation scripts** where GUI tools (like SSMS) are not practical.

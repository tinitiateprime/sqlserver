5. Fields discovered more than 25 years ago (as of today)
6. Production records in the last 7 days (ending today)
7. Open invoices older than 30 days (aging snapshot today)
8. Payments posted today

6. Shipments in the next 7 calendar days from today (planning window)
7. Contracts starting in the next quarter
8. Production window: current week (Mon..Sun based on DATEFIRST defaults)
9. Add 90 days to invoice date as hypothetical due date and flag overdue
10. PipelineFlow last 30 days aggregated per pipeline

## Date Formatting (FORMAT)
1. ShipDate as 'yyyy-MM'
2. Invoice month label 'MMM yyyy'
3. ProductionDate 'dd-MMM'
4. Drilling StartDate 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm'
5. PaymentDate full day name and date
6. Inventory SnapshotDate as ISO basic 'yyyyMMdd'
7. Contract StartDate quarter label 'Qn yyyy'
8. FlowDate culture-specific month (German)
9. CreatedAt (UTC) standardized ISO 8601
10. Invoice date week number (using FORMAT)

## Weekday Function (DATEPART weekday)
1. Shipments count by weekday (1..7)
2. Average pipeline flow by weekday
3. Production Oil by weekday name
4. Payments by weekday name
5. Drilling starts by weekday
6. Inventory snapshots by weekday (top 7 days)
7. Invoices by weekday number
8. Contracts started by weekday
9. Maintenance events by weekday
10. Fields discovered by weekday (if DiscoveryDate set)

## Date to String (CONVERT with style)
1. InvoiceDate as 23 (yyyy-mm-dd)
2. ShipDate as 112 (yyyymmdd)
3. PaymentDate as 101 (mm/dd/yyyy)
4. FlowDate as 103 (dd/mm/yyyy)
5. SnapshotDate as 105 (dd-mm-yyyy)
6. StartDate as 106 (dd mon yyyy)
7. EndDate as 107 (Mon dd, yyyy)
8. Contract StartDate as 110 (mm-dd-yyyy)
9. InvoiceDate as 120 (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss) — time part 00:00:00 for date column
10. DiscoveryDate as 113 (dd mon yyyy hh:mm:ss:mmm)

## DateTime to String (CONVERT with style)
1. Customer CreatedAt as 120 (ISO-ish)
2. Pipeline CreatedAt as 121 (ODBC canonical w/ milliseconds)
3. Production CreatedAt as 126 (ISO 8601)
4. Payment CreatedAt as 113 (dd mon yyyy hh:mm:ss:mmm)
5. Invoice CreatedAt as 109 (mon dd yyyy hh:mi:ss:mmmAM)
6. AssetMaintenance CreatedAt as 100 (mon dd yyyy hh:miAM)
7. Shipment CreatedAt as 114 (hh:mi:ss:mmm)
8. Facility CreatedAt as 20 (ODBC canonical)
9. Contract CreatedAt as 9 (mon dd yyyy hh:miAM)
10. Inventory CreatedAt as 127 (ISO8601 with timezone Z if datetimeoffset; here datetime2)

## String to Date (CONVERT/CAST)
1. '2025-07-15' style 23 → date
2. '07/15/2025' style 101 → date
3. '15/07/2025' style 103 → date
4. '15-07-2025' style 105 → date
5. ISO basic '20250715' style 112 → date
6. Parse shipment month text to date (first day) using PARSE (en-US)
7. Values set → convert to date (multi-row)
8. Convert dd Mon yyyy strings using PARSE (en-GB)
9. Convert '2025/07/15' style 111 (yyyy/mm/dd)
10. Convert '2025.07.15' style 102 (yyyy.mm.dd)

## String to DateTime (CONVERT/TRY_PARSE)
1. '2025-07-15 14:30:00' style 120 → datetime
2. '07/15/2025 02:30 PM' style 22 → datetime

9. Convert with timezone '2025-07-15 14:30:00 +00:00' to datetimeoffset
10. Build datetime from date + time string

## DateTime and TimeZone (AT TIME ZONE / SWITCHOFFSET)
1. Current UTC and India Standard Time (IST)
2. Customer CreatedAt UTC → IST
3. Invoice CreatedAt UTC → Pacific Standard Time (PST/PDT auto-handled)
4. Local-date (IST) for payments grouped by day

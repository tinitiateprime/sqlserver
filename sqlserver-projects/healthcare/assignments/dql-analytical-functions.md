* Replace literal values as needed on your instance.
```sql
DECLARE @RefStart date = '2025-07-01';
DECLARE @RefEnd   date = '2025-07-31';
DECLARE @Today    date = CAST(GETDATE() AS date);
```

## Aggregate Functions

2. July appointments per provider
3. Total claim charge per patient (lifetime)
4. Total payment per claim (lifetime)
5. Average lab result by TestName (repeat per row)
6. Running (cumulative) charges per patient by ClaimDate
7. Running appointment count per provider (chronological)
8. Claim amount as % of patient’s total
9. 3-point moving average of lab value per patient+test (current & 2 prev)
10. Min/Max claim per patient (on each claim row)

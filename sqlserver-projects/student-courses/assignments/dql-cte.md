# DQL - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) Assignments

## CTE
1. Get students enrolled after 2024-01-01
2. Count courses per student
3. Compute semester durations
4. Top 5 credit-heavy courses
5. Extract email domains
6. Join students and enrollments
7. Average credits by semester
8. Courses with no enrollments
9. Full names of students
10. Semesters starting in 2025

## Using Multiple CTEs
1. Students below average course load
2. Enrollments in courses > 3 credits
3. Long semesters with many courses
4. Top 3 students by enrollments
5. Names and emails combined
6. Semesters with above-average course count
7. Students with no enrollments
8. Course names and their enrollment counts
9. Semester-course mapping
10. Students ordered by enrollment date

## Recursive CTEs
1. Generate numbers 1 to 10
2. List weekly start dates for each semester
3. Expand all dates for semester 1
4. Fibonacci sequence up to 100
5. Factorial 1! to 5!
6. Generate sequence up to student count
7. Sequential semesters by ID
8. Duplicate a specific enrollment 3 times
9. Reverse string 'ABC'
10. Numbers 1 to max semester_id

# DQL - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) Assignments

## CTE
1. Use a CTE to select parts with price > 10.
2. CTE of supplier summaries (id and name), then select from it.
3. CTE to compute part name lengths.
4. CTE to get average price per supplier.
5. CTE for parts starting with 'G'.
6. CTE to extract city from supplier address.
7. CTE to tag parts as Cheap/Moderate/Expensive.
8. CTE to list NULL-email suppliers.
9. CTE to compute price markup (+20%).
10. CTE to find parts with description containing 'valve'.

## Using Multiple CTEs
1. CTE1 parts >10, CTE2 join to suppliers.
2. CTE1 avg price, CTE2 count parts, then join.
3. CTE parts with 'G', CTE suppliers in Anytown, then cross join.
4. CTE of parts and CTE of markups, then union.
5. CTE suppliers, CTE contact info, then join.
6. CTE for cheap parts, CTE for expensive parts.
7. CTE for part lengths, CTE for supplier name lengths.
8. CTE of NULL-phone suppliers and CTE of NULL-description parts.
9. CTE parts by range, CTE average price, then filter.
10. CTE to list suppliers, CTE to list parts, then full join.

## Recursive CTEs
1. Generate numbers 1 to 10.
2. List supplier IDs 1 to max id using Numbers.
3. Compute running total of part prices by part_id.
4. Generate factorial of 5.
5. Generate price multiples 1× to 5× for part_id=1.
6. Build a hierarchy of suppliers by id.
7. Generate date sequence for next 7 days from today.
8. Number parts sequentially.
9. Generate powers of 2 up to 2^5.
10. Build a breadcrumb trail of supplier IDs.

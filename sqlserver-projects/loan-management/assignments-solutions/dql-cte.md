# DQL - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) Assignments Solutions

## CTE
```sql
-- 1. Use a CTE to list loans with principal > 20000.
WITH HighLoans AS (
  SELECT * FROM loan_management.loans
  WHERE principal > 20000
)
SELECT * FROM HighLoans;

-- 2. Use a CTE to compute total payments per loan.
WITH PaymentTotals AS (
  SELECT loan_id, SUM(amount) AS total_paid
    FROM loan_management.loan_payments
   GROUP BY loan_id
)
SELECT * FROM PaymentTotals;

-- 3. Use a CTE to find average payment per loan.
WITH AvgPayments AS (
  SELECT loan_id, AVG(amount) AS avg_payment
    FROM loan_management.loan_payments
   GROUP BY loan_id
)
SELECT * FROM AvgPayments;

-- 4. Use a CTE to list active loans with borrower names.
WITH ActiveLoans AS (
  SELECT l.loan_id, l.principal, l.status, b.full_name
    FROM loan_management.loans AS l
    JOIN loan_management.borrowers AS b
      ON l.borrower_id = b.borrower_id
   WHERE l.status = 'Active'
)
SELECT * FROM ActiveLoans;

-- 5. Use a CTE to compute loan duration in days.
WITH LoanDurations AS (
  SELECT loan_id,
         DATEDIFF(day, start_date, DATEADD(month, term_months, start_date)) AS duration_days
    FROM loan_management.loans
)
SELECT * FROM LoanDurations;

-- 6. Use a CTE to find borrowers with more than one loan.
WITH LoanCounts AS (
  SELECT borrower_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM loan_management.loans
   GROUP BY borrower_id
)

-- 7. Use a CTE to list loans started this year.
WITH ThisYearLoans AS (
  SELECT * FROM loan_management.loans
   WHERE YEAR(start_date) = YEAR(GETDATE())
)
SELECT * FROM ThisYearLoans;

-- 8. Use a CTE to find late payments (payment_date > loan end date).
WITH LatePayments AS (
  SELECT p.payment_id, p.loan_id, p.payment_date,
         DATEADD(month, l.term_months, l.start_date) AS loan_end
    FROM loan_management.loan_payments AS p
    JOIN loan_management.loans AS l
      ON p.loan_id = l.loan_id

SELECT payment_id, loan_id, payment_date
  FROM LatePayments
 WHERE payment_date > loan_end;

-- 9. Use a CTE to find high‐interest loans (>5%).
WITH HighRateLoans AS (
  SELECT * FROM loan_management.loans
   WHERE interest_rate > 0.05
)
SELECT * FROM HighRateLoans;

-- 10. Use a CTE to list payments with principal ratio.
WITH PaymentRatio AS (
  SELECT payment_id, loan_id, amount,
         principal_component * 1.0 / amount AS principal_ratio
    FROM loan_management.loan_payments

## CONTEXT
# ðŸ“˜ SQL Server Performance Tuning â€“ Training Program

Welcome to the **SQL Server Performance Tuning Training**!  
This program is designed for students and professionals who want to learn how to identify, analyze, and resolve performance issues in SQL Server.  

The training is structured over **5 days** with a mix of theory and hands-on labs.  

---

## ðŸ—“ Training Outline  

### Day 1 â€“ Introduction & Performance Fundamentals  
- SQL Server query processing lifecycle  
- Execution plans (estimated vs. actual)  
- Role of statistics in query performance  
- Identifying performance bottlenecks  

**Hands-On Labs:**  
- View execution plans in SSMS  
- Compare query performance with/without statistics  
- Find the slowest query in a sample workload  

---

### Day 2 â€“ Indexing Strategies  
- Clustered vs. Non-clustered indexes  
- Covering and filtered indexes  
- Columnstore indexes  
- Index fragmentation & maintenance  

**Hands-On Labs:**  
- Create and test indexes  
- Optimize queries using covering indexes  
- Rebuild vs. reorganize indexes  

---

### Day 3 â€“ Query Optimization Techniques  
- Writing SARGable queries  
- Avoiding SELECT * and implicit conversions  
- Parameter sniffing issues  
- Temp tables vs. table variables  
- Common query anti-patterns  

**Hands-On Labs:**  
- Rewrite non-SARGable queries  
- Demonstrate parameter sniffing and apply fixes  
- Compare performance between temp tables and table variables  

---

### Day 4 â€“ Monitoring & Troubleshooting  
- SQL Profiler & Extended Events  
- Using DMVs for performance tuning  
- Query Store basics  
- Deadlocks & blocking  
- Wait statistics  

**Hands-On Labs:**  
- Capture slow queries with Extended Events  
- Find top resource-consuming queries using DMVs  
- Simulate and resolve blocking  
- Analyze wait statistics  

---

### Day 5 â€“ Advanced Tuning & Best Practices  
- Table partitioning  
- Parallelism (MAXDOP, cost threshold tuning)  
- TempDB optimization  
- Adaptive query processing (SQL Server 2017+)  
- Best practices for performance baselining  

**Hands-On Labs:**  
- Partition a large table and run queries  
- Test different MAXDOP settings  
- Optimize TempDB configuration  
- Generate a performance baseline with Query Store  

---

## âœ… Learning Outcomes  
By the end of this training, you will be able to:  
- Read and analyze execution plans  
- Design and maintain efficient indexing strategies  
- Optimize poorly written queries  
- Monitor SQL Server performance using built-in tools  
- Troubleshoot real-world performance issues  
- Apply best practices for long-term performance tuning

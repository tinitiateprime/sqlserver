## CONTEXT
# 📘 SQL Server Performance Tuning – Training Program

## Welcome to the **SQL Server Performance Tuning Training**!  

Performance tuning is one of the most critical skills for a database professional. Even the best-designed applications can suffer from slow queries, blocking, and inefficient resource usage if the database layer is not optimized.

In this training, we focus on:

•	Understanding how SQL Server works internally – how queries are parsed, optimized, and executed.

•	Identifying performance bottlenecks using execution plans, statistics, and monitoring tools.

•	Applying tuning techniques such as indexing strategies, query rewrites, and configuration adjustments.

•	Troubleshooting real-world issues like blocking, deadlocks, and slow-running queries.

•	Building best practices for long-term performance and scalability.

### Why Learn Performance Tuning?

•	🕒 Save time – Queries that take minutes can often be tuned to run in seconds.

•	💰 Save costs – Optimized databases require fewer hardware resources.

•	🚀 Improve scalability – Applications can handle more users and more data.

•	🔍 Gain deeper insight – Learn how SQL Server makes decisions behind the scenes.

•	🎯 Boost your career – Performance tuning is one of the most in-demand skills for DBAs and developers.

## What You’ll Get From This Training

•	Hands-on practice with real-world tuning scenarios.

•	The ability to read and understand execution plans.

•	Knowledge of when and how to use indexes effectively.

•	Skills to optimize queries and database design.

•	Confidence in using SQL Server tools (DMVs, Query Store, Profiler, Extended Events) to monitor and troubleshoot issues.
